This application is entirely done in Java using as a GUI the Swing library included. Its purpose is to simulate a car dealership in which a user logs into the system and picks which cars are available from the list and sends a requrest to a Dealer in order to be validated and set a possible discussion date. The Dealer views the requests and chooses to validate them or not and a date is automatically generated for the user.
